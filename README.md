* A Sass library of commonly used mixins
* Included libraries:

## Download

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/sebastianekstrom/boilerplate/archive/v1.8.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sebastianekstrom/boilerplate.git`

## Getting started

Step 1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)

Step 2. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
```shell
npm install --global gulp
```

Step 3. Install the npm dependencies
```shell
cd path/to/project
npm install
```

Step 4. Run Gulp's default task
```shell
gulp
```

## Gulp tasks

There are two Gulp tasks; `gulp` and `gulp --production`.

`gulp` is the default task which will concatenate all Javascript files in to `dist/js/script.js`. The task will also concatenate the Sass files into `dist/css/style.css`, as well as running autoprefixer on the outputted CSS. It will also start a local server, as well as watching all the Sass/JS files and autoreload the browser upon change.

`gulp --production` is the production task and will do everything the default task does, as well as compressing the JS and CSS files.
